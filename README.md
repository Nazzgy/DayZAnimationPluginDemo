# DayZ Blender Animation Plugin 	

 ### Requires Atleast Blender Version 3.6.8

This plugin allows you to import, edit, and export .txo and .txa files. With the use of DayZ Tools' Workbench, you can import them into your mod; Workbench converts the files to a .xob or .anm respectfully. The tool also allows you to add/edit animation events with the use of the sidebar menu
 
The included .txa and .blend samples can help you get started.

Also included is an unpacked SVD (rifle) sample mod, and .blend samples of the IK, w_states, and fire animations for this SVD. 


Using Mikero's DeAnmGUI.exe (paid version of Mikeros tools) is highly recommended, but not required.
